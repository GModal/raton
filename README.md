# Raton

Raton was a mouse-to-midi controller for the Linux platform. It uses alsa midi, was written with Glade2 and requires GTK2.4+ libraries (which are OLD).

It was linked from the Linuxsound.org page (still is!), but never received widespread use. I've upgraded the source enough that it will make & compile in Debian 10 (Buster) stable, so it should still build for most distros. The README txt file in the src directory has more info.

It may be little more than a historical footnote, but I felt the source needed a home.

Also -- it still works very well. Not fancy, but useful.
